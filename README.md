## About
This is a simple text based simulator i made with Java. I'm planning to extend this into a more 
game-like direction, where the player could manage a whole team of gladiators n√°nd get them to 
fight against other teams.

I borrowed the character builds, weapons and combat rules from 1st edition RuneQuest tabletop game.

## How to play
You will need to add Lombok to your build path.
The text will appear in console.

## Commands
q-quit, c-commands, n-start/next turn, a-fighter a desc, b-fighter b desc
